<h3 class="text-center">Curiosity hasn’t killed this cat</h3>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

I have always been interested in the how and why of things. At 3 years old, while on a hike with my mom, I sat down in a river, fully clothed (despite it being November in Ohio). When asked why I’d made this choice, I replied, “I needed to find out” and when asked what I’d learned, I replied, “Wet.”  


I’m no longer so impulsive, but my curiosity is still just as tenacious.  


I’ve channeled my lifelong need to “find out” into learning about why people do the things they do, how they think about things, and ways to improve their experiences. 
I took a circuitous route to get here, but my curiosity led me to the world of UX.

In my spare time, you will find me hiking with friends, taking pictures of and drawing plants, doing yoga, and trying not to squeal over every dog I pass on the street.  

Three random facts about me:
- I hate heights but love climbing
- I am a former contortionist/circus artist
- Elephants are my favorite animal
